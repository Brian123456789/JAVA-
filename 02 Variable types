Variables are basically a container in which we put data. There are different data types.

Some are:

int - 4 bytes
float - 4 bytes
double - 8 bytes
char - 2 bytes
short int - 2 bytes
long int - 8 bytes
byte - 1 byte

Sometimes it matters which one of these you use if you want to save on memory. Often it will not matter, in such cases
people often just use int for numbers and string for letters. Long int may be used for very large numbers where accuracy
is needed. 

All numbers with decimals are by default defined as double in java. If needed, you can force decimal numbers to float values.

Char is often used to hold a value of one letter.
