//Here is how to make a char variable and print it. May seem to simple but sometimes just because, you will need it.


//ASCII

/*Ascii is an integer representation of any character on your keyboard. to covert a character to int:


package pkg02char;

  class Main 
  {

   public static void main(String[] args)
            
    {
    System.out.println ((int) c) // this will give you the ascii value (integer representation) of that character, which is 65.
    }
    
    {
    System.out.println ((char) 65) // this will give you the character that is represented by the ascii value.
    }
    
  }
